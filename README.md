# 📊 Loan Eligibility Prediction — Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a **machine learning-based Loan Eligibility Prediction System** built as part of my **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.  
The system predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details using classification models.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Loan eligibility prediction helps financial institutions determine if a customer is likely to repay a loan based on their profile and financial data. Using historical loan datasets, this project builds and evaluates classification models to automate this decision-making process. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
